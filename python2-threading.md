### Motivation
I had a requirement on sending multiple HTTP requests within short amount of time.
The most common way to do this making each request wihtout waiting for another reuqests.
In `node.js`, for example, we can easily achieve this because of standard `HTTP` library supports asynchronous call. But in Python2, since modules like `asyncio` do not exist, I decided to use multi thread.

### Content
We can use `threading` module which is supported by python2.
