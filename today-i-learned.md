## This is TIL (Today I Learned) for logging what I learned

  - in linux, fd (file descriptor) limit is applied per process ([link](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/55319/are-limits-conf-values-applied-on-a-per-process-basis))
  - you can check limits of running process with `cat /proc/<pid>/limits`
  - you can check currently open fds for process at `ls -al /proc/<pid>/fd`
  - yum (package manager) uses yum repos (typically http url) located at `/etc/yum.repos.d/*.repo` to find packages. So if you want to install some packages with certain version unshown in `yum list --showduplicates` command, you can download .repo file which contains the version you want directly from internet and copy it to /etc/yum.repos.d. Then you can find/install the version you want
