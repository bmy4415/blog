### Reason why I write blog
1. I forget thigs I have done frequently. For example, in the past I was wokring
as a server developer and coded some REST APIs with `node.js`. But 10 months
after I quit that company, I cannot even loop over javscript arrays!. This kindof language specific grammar is very tiny things and I can restore it soon, but I also want to
recall other famous concepts like Promise, async/await soon. That's why I write my own blog,
`to remember what I studied`.

### Reason why I select github repo as blog place
I tried several blog templates, e.g, medium, hugo, ...etc. But since I do not
write posts frequently, the time spent on set up is logner than time spent on
writing post!. In github, only I have to do is write markdown file. So I finally
select github repository as my blog place.
