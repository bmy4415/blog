### Reason why I select github repo as blog place
I tried several blog templates, e.g, medium, hugo, ...etc. But since I do not
write posts frequently, the time spent on set up is logner than time spent on
writing post!. In github, only I have to do is write markdown file. So I finally
select github repository as my blog place.
